Iris Flower Classification

This project focuses on building a machine learning classification model to identify the species of Iris flowers based on their petal and sepal dimensions.
The Iris dataset is a widely used and well-known dataset in machine learning and pattern recognition.

🎯 Objective
To classify Iris flowers into one of three species:
Setosa
Versicolor
Virginica


🧩 Dataset
The dataset includes the following numerical features:
Feature	Description
Sepal Length	Length of the sepal in cm
Sepal Width	Width of the sepal in cm
Petal Length	Length of the petal in cm
Petal Width	Width of the petal in cm


🧠 Machine Learning Models Used
Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Model performance was evaluated using:
Accuracy Score
Confusion Matrix
Classification Report


🔧 Tools & Technologies
Component	Tools Used
Programming Language	Python
Data Handling	Pandas, NumPy
Visualization	Matplotlib, Seaborn
ML Framework	Scikit-learn
Notebook	Jupyter Notebook
